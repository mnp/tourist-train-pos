<p>To make a new customer: Press Customer button in menu bar.  Fill in the
form and press Create.</p>

<p>To find a customer: Press Customer button in the menu bar. Fill in the
minimum information you know and press the Find button. If multiple
customers were found, you can choose from a list of customers presented, or
repeat this process with more information.

<u>Special Note Concerning Rates:</u> If you change the rates in a customer,
<b>NO RESERVATIONS</b> are affected.  After changing the customer, you must
go to each reservation of the customer you want to have the new rates and
press "Change" in that reservation.  This seems awkward but it allows for
customers having new and old rates at once.
