<p>Important: there must be a customer to make a reservation.</p>

<p>If there is an existing customer, find the customer first by going to the
      customer screen and using the Find button there.  Then, use a Make
      Reservation button on that screen to jump to the reservation screen.
</p>

<p>After creating a reservation, the form returns with the Create button
again so you can create another reservation for the same customer.  Just
be sure to clear the ID field first.
</p>

<p> Regarding the separate <b>Total</B> and <b>Amount Due</b> displays.
They should show the same number for reservations which are not paid up.
After checkin, if they're paid up, <b>Amount Due</b> will show 0 but <b>Total</b> will
continue to show how much they paid.
