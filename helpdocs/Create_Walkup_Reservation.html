<p> 
      Create a walkup customer by first checking one or two trains
      in the left two panes.  (See help there).
</p> 
<p> 
      Next, check off the passenger numbers.
</p> 
<p> 
      Passenger name and state are optional.  The name may be helpful
      if the passenger is not boarding immediately.
</p> 
<p> 
      Finally check one of the reserve buttons.  "Reserve" will create
      a Group or Rack reservation but not check it in. "Reserve and Checkin"
      will create the reservation and also check them in: it's for 
      passengers who are boarding immediately.
