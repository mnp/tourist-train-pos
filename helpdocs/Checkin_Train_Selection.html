      Trains departing today are shown in the left pane, and tomorrow in the
      center pain.  If the date is set with the 'View Date' button, then
      that date and the one following will show.

      If either says "No records matched", it means no trains are scheduled
      for that day.  The number of trains will vary.  The number of
      available seats is shown in the second column.  The number will turn
      colors as the available seats approach zero.

      To create a walkup reservation, check one or two trains from these
      boxes.  For a one way trip, pick one "out" train.  For a round trip,
      pick an "Out" and a "Ret" train.
