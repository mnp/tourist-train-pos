<p>A walkup customer is a second class citizen in the reservation system:
<ul>
  <li> There is no customer record with name, address, etc.
  <li> Walkups can only be Rack or Group fares.  
  <li> If they have coupons, they can be ticketed as Specials: in which
	case you would enter some riders in the Specials box and then
	click Reserve or Reserve Group.
</ul>
