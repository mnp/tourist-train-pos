System users can have four privilege levels: Admin is for administrators 
and allows access to all pages. Dev is for developers and is like Admin but
also shows debugging info.  Agent limits access to reservation, customer,
daily, and checkin pages.  It also will not allow changing a daily page
if the date is not today.
