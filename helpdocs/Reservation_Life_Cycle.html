<p>
      A full reservation is created on the Reservation screen.  A walkup
      reservation, with fewer details, is created on the Checkin screen.
</p>
<p>
      Reservations are normally checked in when the passengers appear and
      are given tickets.
</p>
<p>
      A reservation may be released, which means the seats are made
      available on the trains involved.  This happens automatically at 15
      minutes before the first train departs.
</p>
<p>
      A reservation may be deleted any time, which also releases it.  This
      also may happen automatically when the first train departs if the
      riders never checked in.
